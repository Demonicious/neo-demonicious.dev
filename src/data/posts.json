I&#39;d always been a Vue and Angular user but wanted to give React a fair chance. I watched a crash course by <a href=\"https://youtube.com/traversymedia\">Traversy Media</a> and decided to work on a project. I wanted to build something related to the coronavirus that could be helpful / informative. CORONASTATS.CO was my excuse to learn React.</p>\n<p>I parsed the data initially from <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/\">Worldometers</a> and later from many other websites to give extremely detailed and updated statistics for the coronavirus. I had cases per country, as-well as per city &amp; province for some prominent countries (The US, India, The UK). I also had a news section that parsed links to news articles from various different websites. I used a cron-job to fetch new data every 15 minutes and generated a static site that was requested by the React App and all the data was presented in a good looking interface.</p>\n<p>I had no hopes of it doing well but just to show it off, I posted the link on ProductHunt and Reddit and it blew up. I received hundereds of thousands of unique visitors and it became Product of the Day on Product Hunt. I also received more than $10,000 in donations and a large amount of users praised it as the best coronavirus tracker that exists at the time.</p>\n",
