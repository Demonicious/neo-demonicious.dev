The course was designed to take a student with no knowledge about creating websites to someone who fundamentally understands how they are structured as-well as has a path to follow down the road.</p>\n<p>I was invited as the Instructor for the Web Development course. The course was a Full-stack Web Development course which aimed to teach students the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript &amp; PHP through a span of 6 months. It was divided into 3 months for Frontend &amp; 3 months for Backend development.</p>\n<p>My role as an instructor was to deliver lectures &amp; practical examples to the students and answer any of their questions and confusions. I also conducted lab sessions with them where a group of students would complete any given task, handling different aspects of the task. Students were also given bi-weekly assignments and quizzes to revise and sharpen their skills. We completed many projects while learning and I also enjoyed my time with the classroom.</p>\n<p>The curriculum that I designed for the students was:</p>\n<h4 id=\"main-subjects\">Main Subjects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML &amp; CSS</li>\n<li>JavaScript</li>\n<li>Building a Company Website with HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript</li>\n<li>Working with REST APIs</li>\n<li>ES6 JavaScript Features</li>\n<li>PHP</li>\n<li>MySQL</li>\n<li>Object Oriented PHP</li>\n<li>Building a Job Board with PHP &amp; MySQL</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"bonus-subjects\">Bonus Subjects:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Vue.js Crash Course</li>\n<li>Laravel Mini Course</li>\n<li>Building a Pokemon API with Laravel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even though the course was Full-stack development, many students chose the one they were most interested in. As such, they were given special guidance related to their choice and weren&#39;t bothered with things they weren&#39;t interested in.</p>\n<p>The course ended in July of 2022, and some students eventually started working as interns in different organizations (including Nexthon Technologies)</p>\n<p>I really enjoyed my time as an instructor as it was a breath of fresh air and will definitely do this again if given the opportunity.</p>\n",

I&#39;d always been a Vue and Angular user but wanted to give React a fair chance. I watched a crash course by <a href=\"https://youtube.com/traversymedia\">Traversy Media</a> and decided to work on a project. I wanted to build something related to the coronavirus that could be helpful / informative. CORONASTATS.CO was my excuse to learn React.</p>\n<p>I parsed the data initially from <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/\">Worldometers</a> and later from many other websites to give extremely detailed and updated statistics for the coronavirus. I had cases per country, as-well as per city &amp; province for some prominent countries (The US, India, The UK). I also had a news section that parsed links to news articles from various different websites. I used a cron-job to fetch new data every 15 minutes and generated a static site that was requested by the React App and all the data was presented in a good looking interface.</p>\n<p>I had no hopes of it doing well but just to show it off, I posted the link on ProductHunt and Reddit and it blew up. I received hundereds of thousands of unique visitors and it became Product of the Day on Product Hunt. I also received more than $10,000 in donations and a large amount of users praised it as the best coronavirus tracker that exists at the time.</p>\n",
