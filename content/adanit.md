Adan IT Center is an institute that was sponsored by the government to teach students web development for free in the span of 6 months. The course was designed to take a student with no knowledge about creating websites to someone who fundamentally understands how they are structured as-well as has a path to follow down the road.

I was invited as the Instructor for the Web Development course. The course was a Full-stack Web Development course which aimed to teach students the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript & PHP through a span of 6 months. It was divided into 3 months for Frontend & 3 months for Backend development.

My role as an instructor was to deliver lectures & practical examples to the students and answer any of their questions and confusions. I also conducted lab sessions with them where a group of students would complete any given task, handling different aspects of the task. Students were also given bi-weekly assignments and quizzes to revise and sharpen their skills. We completed many projects while learning and I also enjoyed my time with the classroom.

The curriculum that I designed for the students was:

#### Main Subjects:

- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript
- Building a Company Website with HTML, CSS & JavaScript
- Working with REST APIs
- ES6 JavaScript Features
- PHP
- MySQL
- Object Oriented PHP
- Building a Job Board with PHP & MySQL

#### Bonus Subjects:

- Vue.js Crash Course
- Laravel Mini Course
- Building a Pokemon API with Laravel

Even though the course was Full-stack development, many students chose the one they were most interested in. As such, they were given special guidance related to their choice and weren't bothered with things they weren't interested in.

The course ended in July of 2022, and some students eventually started working as interns in different organizations (including Nexthon Technologies)

I really enjoyed my time as an instructor as it was a breath of fresh air and will definitely do this again if given the opportunity.
