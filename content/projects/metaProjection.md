MetaProjection is a website that aggregates multiple Canadian federal electoral projections in order to provide an overview of how the election is playing out. I made this project during the run-up to the 2019 Canadian federal election because I found myself checking multiple electoral projection sites that would sometimes have conflicting information. MetaProjection.ca gives a balanced overview of the election by combining the results of multiple reputable poll-trackers.
