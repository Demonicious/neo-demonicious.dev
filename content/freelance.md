title: Freelancing - Backend Development
eventType: job
date: 2017-12-01
excerpt: I started freelancing in late 2017. I worked with a large amount of clients all over the world & built many small - medium scale projects. Most of my work included modifying pre-existing codebases but often I was tasked with building something new. I offered Backend Development services in PHP, Laravel, CodeIgniter, WordPress more. I stopped freelancing when I started a full-time job.
